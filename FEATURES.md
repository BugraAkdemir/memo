# Memo — Comprehensive Feature Catalog

This document provides a detailed breakdown of every feature integrated into the **Memo AI Memory Shell**. From architectural persistence to sensory multimodality, here is how Memo empowers your local AI experience.

---

## 1. 🧠 Core Intelligence & Memory

### Persistent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Memo isn't just a chat; it's a "Second Brain."
- **Semantic Indexing**: Every interaction is automatically embedded and stored in a local vector database.
- **Contextual Recall**: Before every response, Memo performs a similarity search to retrieve the most relevant past conversations (Top-K matching).
- **Infinite Context**: Long-term memory allows the AI to remember details from weeks or months ago, regardless of the current model's window.

### Model-Agnostic Engine
- **Internal Llama-Server**: Powered by `llama.cpp` for high-performance GGUF inference.
- **Dedicated Embedding Server**: A second internal server can run specifically for memory indexing, ensuring chat performance remains untouched.
- **External Provider Support**: Seamlessly connects to LM-Studio or any OpenAI-compatible local API (Port 1234/8081).

## 2. 🏛️ Architecture & Persistence

### Binary-Atomic Persistence (.gob)
- **High Performance**: Uses Go’s native `.gob` format for ultra-fast binary serialization.
- **Atomic Writes**: Each memory is its own file, preventing database corruption and ensuring data integrity.
- **Lazy Loading**: Data is pulled from the disk only when semantically relevant, keeping RAM usage extremely lean.

### Privacy & Local Isolation
- **100% Offline**: No data ever leaves your computer. No telemetry, no logs, no cloud dependencies.
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: Your mind stays on your hardware.

### Remote Access Server
- **Local Network Web Bridge**: Enable "Remote Access" in settings to chat with your local Memo from other devices on your Wi-Fi (mobile, tablet, etc.).

## 3. 🏭 Model Management (The Factory)

### Integrated Hugging Face Search
- **Direct Repository Access**: Search for models on Hugging Face directly within the app.
- **Repo ID Support**: Paste any Hugging Face GGUF repo ID to fetch available files instantly.

### System Diagnostics
- **VRAM & GPU Check**: Auto-detection of available NVIDIA/AMD VRAM.
- **Compatibility Badge**: Flags models as "GPU Compatible" or warns about "Insufficient VRAM" before you download.

### Background Download Manager
- **Parallel Downloading**: High-speed GGUF fetching with real-time percentage and speed tracking.
- **Lifecycle Control**: One-click Start, Stop, and Update for all local models.

## 4. ⚡ Interaction & User Experience

### Live Mode (Streaming)
- **Token-by-Token Rendering**: Watch the AI "type" its responses in real-time.
- **Thinking State**: A pulsing "Memo is thinking..." status provides visual feedback before the first token arrives.
- **Cursor UI**: A blinking terminal-style cursor (`▊`) follows the stream.

### Incognito Mode
- **Zero-Persistence**: A secure toggle that disables all memory saving and history logging for sensitive sessions.
- **Volatile Context**: Context exists only within that specific session and is wiped upon closing.

### Performance HUD
- **Real-time Stats**: Hover over the timestamp to see generation speed (tok/s), total tokens, and precise duration metrics.

## 5. 👁️ Multimodality & Senses

### Vision Support (Multimodal)
- **Image Integration**: Drag-and-drop or upload images for analysis (requires a multimodal-capable GGUF like Llava or Moondream).
- **Base64 Processing**: Local, secure image encoding.

### File Contextualization
- **Document Indexing**: Attach code files (.go, .js, .py) or documents (.md, .txt) to give the AI massive instant context for a specific task.

### Local STT (Speech-to-Text)
- **Offline Transcription**: Record voice messages directly in the app.
- **Bundled Engine**: Uses a localized environment (Vosk/Whisper equivalent) for zero-latency, private transcription.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Greige" Minimalism
- **Focus-First UI**: Minimalist color palette to reduce cognitive load.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed for both desktop-wide and mobile-narrow views.
- **Onboarding Wizard**: A guided setup for name, persona, and initial diagnostics.
